description: "Max Hill needed help integrating an MLS IDX feed into his realtor website created through GoDaddy's website builder. Quickly, I informed him of the need to move his website to a WordPress solution which would allow me to utilize a popular IDX service's plugin to achieve this feature. <br/><br/>While corresponding with the developers of the service's plugins to add some needed functionality to the plugin for his requirements, I also created some local photography and videography media to use in combination with his supplied media in preparing his website for its eventual launch. <br/><br/>Once the website met all of his requirements, I created a short 'Quick Guide' showing him how to add/remove/modify content and listings from his website which allowed him the ease and full autonomy of controlling the details of his website without having to consult me."
