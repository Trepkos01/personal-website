description: "Maria Hughes reached out to me to create an online portfolio and eCommerce shop for her artwork with a short deadline to launch. She provided a series of comparative websites that she wanted me to draw design and functionality inspiration from. Judging by her requirements and short deadline for the website, I chose to utilize Squarespace's business platform and one of their existing templates. <br/><br/>While designing the website, I created my own custom copy for the textual portions (giving her the option to replace it eventually if necessary) and perused her social media accounts for artwork that I could utilize in the graphical aspect of the design of her website. Toward the completion of the project, I provided a series of short video tutorials instructing her on how to add and modify the content on her website."
